# Somatic Variant Analysis Pipeline

### Some questions before dwelving into the analysis pipeline
1) What is meant by variant analysis? how does it help us in understanding biology?
2) What are the most popular applications of variant analysis in life science and clinical research?
3) How is data generated from a variant analysis experiment (wet lab)? what should be the experimental design and statistical tests considerations?
4) What bioinformatics tools and packages are commonly used in a variant analysis pipeline? Is the analysis ecosystem strong in R, Python or stand alone open source softwares?
