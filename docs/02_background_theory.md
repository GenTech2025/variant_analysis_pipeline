## Genomic Variance and Its Role

1) What is Genomic Variance?

    Differences in DNA sequences among different members of a species (between two people) or across different species (between humans and apes). These differences in DNA are responsible for the different characteristics between different members of a species or across species.

2) Why should we study about genomic variance?

    Genomic variance has been an indispensible tool across various fields of life science and clinical research, spanning across different fields such as evolutionary biology, conservational biology, plant sciences and translational research.
        This pipeline focuses on analyzing datasets from clinical studies to better understand how genomic variance across different individuals can contribute to disorders and diseases.

3) What are the different types of genomic variants?

    There are in total four major types of genomic variants as listed below:
    - **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**: Modification of a single *base* in a genome
    - **Small Insertions/Deletions (Indels)**: loci where a few bases have been added or removed
    - **Structural Variants (SVs)**: refers to broad collection of variants like *inversions, translocations, and large insertions or deletions*
    - **Copy Number Variants (CNVs)**: more than few copies of the same sequence across a genome. Depending on the size, copy number variants are sometimes considered a subcategory of structural variants.
